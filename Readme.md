# Lab 15 - 2D Array

## Lab Goal
Since we are just starting 2 dimensional arrays this lab will give you practice traversing a 2d array.

## Instructions
* Complete the method `printMatrix` to print the array in a 2 dimensional fashion.  Things do not need to line up perfectly.
* Complete the method `matrixSum` to return the sum of all of the values in the 2d array.
* Complete the method `countAppearances` to return the number of times a provided number appears in the array.
* You need to edit the `main` method to create two more 2d arrays and run the above methods on them.
* Complete all javadoc comment with the proper tags.

## Sample Output
```
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16
The sum is 136
The number 5 appears 1 times.
```

## Notes
* The Checkstyle config url is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* Make sure you modify the link at the top of your **Readme.md** to reflect your username if you want the badge at the top to represent the status of your code.

## Grading
* 20 - `printMatrix` works correctly
* 25 - `matrixSum` works correctly
* 25 - `countAppearances` works correctly
* 20 - `main` has a total of 3 matrices and runs all three methods on each matrix
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes Checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
